This project is a game, but now it's only a simple program to insert datas in
a distant database. It's writed in cpp with sdl and mysql++ libraries.

How to build ?

With cmake :

1)
Install ttf-unifont build-essential, libsdl1.2-dev, libsdl-image1.2, libmysql++3, libmysql++-dev

optional : libmysql++-doc (for mysql++ samples)

2)
Build SDL_ttf-2 and SDL_image with
./configure, make, sudo make install
they are in tamagotchi/library

3)
make clean
